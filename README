This software solves MQ systems on CUDA-capable GPUs.

This implementation is based on the source code from Hsieh-Chung (Kevin) Chen,
Tung (Tony) Chou, and Ruben Niederhagen (see AUTHORS file) from the paper "Fast
Exhaustive Search for Polynomial Systems in F2" by Charles Bouillaguet,
Hsieh-Chung Chen, Chen-Mou Cheng, Tony Chou, Ruben Niederhagen, Adi Shamir, and
Bo-Yin Yang (CHES 2010, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 6225, pp.
203â€”218. Springer, 2010).

The input file format is the same as used in the Fukuoka MQ challenges [1].

The script 'gen_sys.py' can be used to generate a solvable random system for a
given number of variables and equations.

The script 'fix.py' can be used to fix some variables in an input system.

See the Makefile for examples, e.g., 'make test-small' and 'make test-large'.


Requirements:

- CUDA release 9.0
- Python 3.5.2
